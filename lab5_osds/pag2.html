<br>Carlos Ray "Chuck" Norris (born March 10, 1940) is an American martial artist and actor.
<br>He is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and judo.[1]
<br>After serving in the United States Air Force, Norris won many martial arts championships and later founded his own discipline, Chun Kuk Do.
<br>Shortly after, in Hollywood, Norris trained celebrities in martial arts.
<br>Norris went on to appear in a minor role in The Wrecking Crew (1968).
<br>Friend and fellow martial artist Bruce Lee invited him to play one of the main villains in The Way of the Dragon (1972).
<br>While Norris continued acting, friend and student Steve McQueen suggested he take it seriously.
<br>Norris took the starring role in the action film Breaker! Breaker! (1977), which turned a profit.
<br>His second lead, Good Guys Wear Black (1978), became a hit, and he soon became a popular action film star.
<br>
<br>Norris went on to star in a streak of bankable independently made action and martial arts films, with A Force of One (1979), The Octagon (1980), and An Eye for an Eye (1981).
<br>This made Norris an international celebrity.
<br>He went on to make studio films like Silent Rage (1982) with Columbia, Forced Vengeance (1982) with MGM, and Lone Wolf McQuade (1983) with Orion.
<br>This led Cannon Films to sign Norris into a multiple film deal, starting with Missing in Action (1984), which proved to be very successful and launched a trilogy.
<br>Norris started to work almost exclusively on high-profile action films with Cannon, becoming its leading star during the 1980s.
<br>Films with Cannon include Invasion U.S.A (1985), The Delta Force (1986), and Firewalker (1986), among others.
<br>Apart from the Cannon films, Norris made Code of Silence (1985), which was received as one of his best films.
<br>In the 1990s, he played the title role in the long-running CBS television series Walker, Texas Ranger from 1993 to 2001.
<br>Until 2006, Norris continued taking lead roles in action movies.
<br>His last appearance in a major film release was in The Expendables 2 (2012).
<br>
<br>Throughout his film and TV career, Norris diversified from his regular endeavors.
<br>He is a New York Times bestselling author, having penned books on martial arts, exercise, philosophy, politics, Christianity, Western fiction, and biographies.
<br>Norris also appeared in several commercials endorsing several products, most notably being one of the main spokespersons for the Total Gym infomercials.
<br>In 2005, Norris found new fame on the Internet when Chuck Norris facts became an Internet meme documenting humorous, fictional, and often absurd feats of strength and endurance.
<br>Although Norris himself did not produce the "facts", he was hired to endorse many products that incorporated Chuck Norris facts in advertising.
<br>The phenomenon resulted in six books some of them New York Times bestsellers, two video games, and several appearances on talk shows, such as Late Night with Conan O'Brien, in which he read the facts or participated in sketches.
<br>
<br>Early life
<br>Norris was born in Ryan, Oklahoma, on March 10, 1940,[2] to Wilma (née Scarberry, 1921–2024) and Ray Dee Norris, who was a World War II Army soldier,[3] mechanic, bus driver, and a truck driver.
<br>His mother was of Irish descent and his father of Cherokee descent.
<br>[3][4] Norris was named after Carlos Berry, his father's minister.
<br>[3] He was the oldest of three brothers, the younger two being Wieland and Aaron.
<br>Wieland Norris informed his eldest sibling he would not reach his 27th birthday; this prediction came true in 1970 when he was killed in the Vietnam War.
<br>When Norris was 16 years old, his parents divorced,[5] and he later relocated to Prairie Village, Kansas and then to Torrance, California with his mother and brothers.[4]
<br>
<br>Norris has described his childhood as downbeat.
<br>He was nonathletic, shy, and scholastically mediocre.
<br>[6] His father, Ray, worked intermittently as an automobile mechanic, and went on drinking binges that lasted for months at a time.
<br>Embarrassed by his father's behavior and the family's financial plight, Norris developed a debilitating introversion that lasted for his entire childhood.[7]
<br>
<br>Career
<br>1958 to 1969: United States Air Force and martial arts breakthrough
<br>Norris joined the United States Air Force as an Air Policeman (AP) in 1958 and was sent to Osan Air Base, South Korea.
<br>It was there that Norris acquired the nickname "Chuck" and began his training in Tang Soo Do (tangsudo), an interest that led to black belts in that art and the founding of the Chun Kuk Do ("Universal Way") form.
<br>[8] When he returned to the United States, he continued to serve as an AP at March Air Force Base in California.[9][10]
